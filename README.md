**Introduction**: The Stock Management System is a comprehensive desktop application developed to efficiently manage retail shop operations. 
The project focuses on key features such as custom barcode generation, error-free billing, and a paperless workflow.

**Objectives** –
•	Implement a robust barcode generation feature for creating custom barcodes.
•	Ensure error-free billing through automated price calculation and discount application.
•	Digitize and automate processes to eliminate manual paperwork.
•	Provide a centralized platform for managing the entire shop's operations, including inventory, sales, and customer information.

**Technologies Used:**
3.1	 **Java** - Java serves as the primary programming language for developing the Stock Management System. Its platform independence, object-oriented nature, and extensive libraries make it a suitable choice for creating the application's logic and user interface.

3.2	**MySQL** - MySQL is employed as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for the project.

3.3	**JDBC** - Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is utilized to establish a connection between the Java application and the MySQL database.

3.4	**Java Swing** - Java Swing is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Java. It is used to create the graphical user interface of the desktop application. Java Swing provides a set of components for building interactive and user-friendly interfaces, allowing for the design of windows, buttons, forms, and other UI elements.

3.5	**Barcode API** - The Barcode API is integrated into the system to facilitate the generation of custom barcodes. This feature is essential for efficient inventory tracking. The API allows the application to dynamically create and display barcodes for products, streamlining the checkout process and enhancing inventory management.
